## Frontend-nanodegree-resume

Project that programmatically fills in resume information.

Description
-----------
Project to write code that takes the given resume information, filters and formats it using a list of variables that contain the formatting for each of the sections and then places it in the index.html file for display.
The project also shows how the re-usable code in the pre-formatted variables breaks down the process into smaller chunks facilitating the overall process.
All the code in the resumeBuilder.js code was refactored from the initial materials given to separate the concerns into an Model, View, Presenter (MVP) format.
